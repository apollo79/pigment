# Introduction

Pigment is a full-featured UI library for SolidJS. It provides ready to use components for building **web applications** with a consistent look and feel.

## Principles

### Simple

Designed to expose a minimalist API so that you can quickly build what you want.

### Accessible

Built on top of [Kobalte](https://kobalte.dev) a UI toolkit for building accessible web apps and design systems with SolidJS.

### Consistent

Comes with a default theme with support for light and dark modes that ensures a consistent experience in your application.

## Acknowledgment

Pigment would not have been possible without the prior art done by other meaningful projects including:

- Atlassian Design System - https://atlassian.design/
- Joy UI - https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/overview/
