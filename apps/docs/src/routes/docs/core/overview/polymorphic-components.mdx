import { Alert } from "@kobalte/pigment";

# Polymorphic components

Some Pigment components accept a special `asChild` prop that lets you change the root element.

Paired with the `<As>` component this allows you to attach a component accessibility and functional requirements onto your own element instead.

When using this pattern the following rules apply to the component with the `asChild` prop, and it's child `<As>` component :

- CSS classes are combined.
- Styles are combined, if same attribute exists the one from `<As>` win.
- Event handlers are chained, The one from `<As>` get called first.

<Alert status="warning" class="not-prose">
  If you decide to change the default rendered node (e.g. change a `button` to a `div`) then it's up
  to you to ensure the correct accessibility and functionality of your chosen node type.
</Alert>

## With HTML elements

You can use any HTML element with the `As` component. For example, `a` tag will render an anchor:

```tsx
import { As, MenuTrigger } from "@kobalte/pigment";

function App() {
  return (
    <MenuTrigger asChild>
      <As component="a" href="/">
        Trigger
      </As>
    </MenuTrigger>
  );
}
```

## With other components

You can also use polymorphic components with any other component. For example, with `@solidjs/router` Link:

```tsx
import { As, MenuTrigger } from "@kobalte/pigment";
import { Link } from "@solidjs/router";

function App() {
  return (
    <MenuTrigger asChild>
      <As component={Link} href="/">
        Trigger
      </As>
    </MenuTrigger>
  );
}
```
