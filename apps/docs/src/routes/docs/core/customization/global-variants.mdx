# Global Variants

Pigment uses the concept of global variants inspired by [Joy UI](https://mui.com/joy-ui/main-features/global-variants/) which aim to improve consistency across every component in the library.

## Main variants

Pigment provides four main variants: `solid`, `soft`, `outlined`, and `ghost`. These variants are intended to cover the majority of use cases in modern web design.

Each variant conveys a different level of importance in the user interface:

- `solid` is best suited for primary elements and the most important actions on the page.
- `soft`, `outlined`, and `ghost` are better for secondary and tertiary actions.

## Input variants

In addition to the main variants, the `soft-input` and `outlined-input` variants are designed specifically for form UI elements such as text fields, select, checkboxes and radio buttons.

## Selection variants

Pigment's selection variants are intended for elements in a selected or checked state.

## Disabled variant

The disabled variant is intended for elements in a disabled state.
